# challenge-5-work-scheduler-third-party-apis
## Description
This project was developed and designed to be a work day scheduler. This work day shows from 9 am to 5 pm.  The date is shown at the top of the page and changes at the start of each new day. This scheduler is broken down hour by hour. The user can input information in the text area for each hour. There is a save button that will save the user input to local storage and pull the information if the page is refreshed or closed and opened back up. The scheduler will highlight each hour of the day based on the current time. For example, if the current time is 11 am. The 9 am and 10 am time slots will be gray, while 12 pm-5 pm will be highlighted green. The current time slot, in this example, 11 am, would be highlighted red.

WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
